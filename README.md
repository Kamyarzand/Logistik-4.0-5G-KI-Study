## Abstract

This academic paper provides an in-depth analysis of the **convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G network technology, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** as the fundamental pillars driving Logistics 4.0. The study investigates how the high-performance characteristics of 5G—particularly URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication) and Network Slicing—serve as critical enablers for time-sensitive IoT applications within logistics processes.

A key focus is placed on the transformative role of AI in enabling **autonomous, optimized, and predictive logistics scenarios**. This includes detailed analysis of use cases such as:
* **Smart Warehousing:** Optimizing management and automation through AI-driven systems.
* **Predictive Maintenance:** AI-based forecasting of malfunctions in Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) using real-time 5G data.
* **Supply Chain Optimization:** Enhancing transparency and efficiency from distribution to the 'last mile'.

The paper further discusses the significant technical challenges (e.g., interoperability, cybersecurity, and reliability) and the immense opportunities that arise from leveraging these integrated technologies to boost efficiency, scalability, and sustainability in modern supply chains.

### Key Technological Concepts

This study relies on the critical integration of the following core concepts:
* **Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC):** Essential for autonomous control systems (e.g., AGV steering).
* **Network Slicing:** Enabling dedicated virtual networks with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) for specific logistical tasks.
* **Predictive Analytics:** AI-driven models that use real-time IoT data to forecast equipment failure or demand shifts.
* **Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC):** For connecting the vast array of sensors required for comprehensive tracking and smart warehouse monitoring.
